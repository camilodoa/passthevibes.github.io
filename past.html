        <div class='article'>
          Kaiit’s “Miss Shiney” is your new neo-soul jam. Throughout the song,
          Kaiit builds a metaphor of herself as a diamond.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the hook she sings: “I got pressure, she calls me diamond on the weekdays”.
          She paints a picture of herself as Miss Shiney, a diamond who shines
          bright, yet deals with pressure on a regular basis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Later, she brings the listener further into her head and details how
          doubting herself and overthinking are at the root of a lot of her
          life’s stress, singing: “Now that’s wack, I don’t know how to act, a
          false reality that I seem to created in my head, to make me feel I’m
          not deserving of these things I do”.
          <br>
          <br>
          The lyrics are catchy, and emotional. However, the song really caught
          my ear because of the beautiful pairing between Kait’s voice, the
          soulful piano, funky guitar, and simple drum beat. She floats over
          the instrumental, describing the stresses and pressure she puts on
          herself, while implying that she’s still a diamond, shining bright.

            London producer J Rick is back with “Gone”. The song came out Thursday,
            May 24th and continues to showcase his ability and versatility as a
            producer. After producing several tracks for rising UK artist Octavian,
            including his breakout single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz7eyvAMOpA" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Party Here”</a>, J Rick is focusing on
            his own project, No Retreat, No Surrender. “Gone” is the second
            single for the project, after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWvbFN7yhMs" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Short”</a>, which came out back in February.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both tracks are marked by intriguing samples of vocals and tracks
            layered into fluid, changing, synthy beat. “Gone” starts with a sample
            from J Ricks late uncle, British boxer Errol Christie, speaking on
            boxing as one of the only ways for Black people to make it and later
            flips a handful of lyrics from Blackstreet’s 1994 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC6TnBx0HIU" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Before I Let You Go”</a>, before mixing in vocals from a viral
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmMcM8Eb6p4" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">clip</a> of a sermon
            from Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. The samples work perfectly with a
            beat that is always changing, yet keeping the same central themes
            and elements.
            <br>
            <br>
            The music video is equally as exciting. The video adds to the
            feel of “Gone”, pairing the audio with a montage of clips of J Rick
            adventuring, but also the wide variety of other people, places,
            and sights that were a part of his trip to Egypt. The track and
            the video stand out as another creative expression from a talented
            producer, trying to showcase his own individual artistry as opposed
            to taking a backseat to a vocalist. “Gone” is a funky, experimental
            track that adds to the growing hype around J Rick, and his upcoming
            project.

          <div class='article'>
            Ever since his release back in May, rising DMV rapper Xanman has
            been releasing song after song. He started with
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3WGp3lKoss" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">"Pink"
            </a>
            and his
            collab with YungManny
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73mOe7KHFg8" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“First Day Out”</a>, and then released the Big
            Plug N*gga mixtape.
            <br>
            <br>
            His most recent track, is “Hell Yea”, the intro to his upcoming
            mixtape, Hell Yeah. For the past year and a half, Xanman has shown
            off his singing as well as his ability to craft great punchlines.
            “Hell Yea” is all bars. Xanman shows off his energy over a menacing
            beat and spits several catchy lines.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the bars that immediately caught my ear were in his first
            verse when he raps: “I grab the choppa, You better lay there, Walk
            in his house with the Drake, Take Care”. He shortens drako
            (mini AK-47) to Drake, and then uses the second half of the line to
            warn anyone he approaches when armed by referencing Drake’s 2011
            album, Take Care.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Hell Yeaa” is a hard-hitting Xanman song full of energy and clever
            punchlines. Xanman released the song as a music video, which
            showcases his personality while he raps and dances around with a
            posse (and some random people in costumes) in New York City.

          <div class='article'>
            After last July’s set of 3 concerts on U St. in D.C., Goldlink
            thanked the fans from his hometown, and let them know that his next
            project would be distinct from all of his previous work. Just under
            a year later, he dropped Diaspora, a proud celebration of Black
            music and culture with a variety of features hailing from all over
            the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            On Tiff Freestyle, one of the “featureless” songs, Goldlink’s verse
            is introduced and followed by the popular British DJ Tiffany Calver.
            Tiff does her best American accent hyping up Goldlink, which is
            actually pretty convincing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Goldlink’s verse, is an honest reflection on his journey done over
            a smooth piano instrumental. He starts by discussing his aspirations
            to make money and provide for his future children. Goldlink then
            reminisces about hot and hectic DC summers, and talks about his
            come-up.
            <br>
            <br>
            He saves his best bars for last, ending the freestyle highlighting
            his current lavish lifestyle through a few major references to
            Michael Jackson, Prince and Michael Vick. He raps: “I live a life
            like Michael and keep it purple like Prince, Keep like 7 with me,
            got n*ggas callin’ me Vick”.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Tiff Freestyle” is a Goldlink track that may not get as much
            attention as some of the other tracks on Diaspora that pack major
            features, but it is another very strong track from the DC rapper.

          The July 4th episode of Kendall Jenner and Daniel Chetrit’s ZAZA WORLD
          RADIO on Apple Music featured a premier of an unreleased track from
          rising UK artist Bakar. The singer/rapper hailing from Camden, London
          released his debut album Badkid back in May 2018, attracting
          attention in the UK and around the world.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you haven’t heard of Bakar, <i>Badkid</i> is an amazing album,
          highlighting his versatility and influences from classic rock to
          alternative/indie music to hip-hop. However, Bakar’s newest song,
          “Hell & Back”, has a completely different feel from his debut album.
          Bakar stated that he hopes people listen to this track “in the sun”,
          and the song sounds decidedly warmer and more upbeat than the majority
          of the songs on <i>Badkid</i>. The track starts with whistling, over a light
          guitar based instrumental. However, the instrumental is amazingly
          paired with horns from the Onyx Collective’s Isaiah Barr. Throughout
          the track, Bakar showcases his unique voice, singing about meeting a
          lover. One of the lines that immediately stands out is early in the
          song he sings that “she had green eyes like Mountain Dew”, which
          creatively paints a picture in the listener’s head.
          <br>
          <br>
          Bakar cited Camden legend Amy Winehouse as a major influence on
          “Hell & Back” and his upcoming project <i>Will You Be My Yellow?</i>,
          which is slated to release on August 23. An official version has not yet
          been released at the moment, but linked is a rip from ZAZA World
          Radio’s “THE BEST DAYS OF OUR LIVES” episode. Give this track a listen
          and keep an eye out for Bakar’s <i>Will You Be My Yellow?</i>.

            Minute</i>, Nekfeu has risen to superstardom in his native France,
            appearing in films and releasing dance-ready hits that endeared him
            to the broader public, with the help of a slow transition of his
            appearance from crate digger to hot celebrity.

            His new album, <i>Les Étoiles Vagabondes</i> – Vagabond Stars – sees Nekfeu
            leave club music behind and return to the more traditional flows
            that earned him a loyal audience with 1995. Over interesting
            production and alongside gifted featured artists like Damso,
            Nekfeu tells stories rooted in personal experience but vague enough
            to be relatable to a broader audience. Individual tracks can be
            hit-or-miss, but as a whole the album is a new sound for the rapper
            that seems to synthesize his pop and hip-hop influences.

            Perhaps the best track on the album is “Elle Pleut” (“She
            Rains/Cries”). On it, Nek showcases his ability to weave a compelling
            story while navigating a melancholy beat that pairs ambient harmonies
            with a sparse drum sample that drops out for the verse, leaving him
            to rap almost unaccompanied. The story of a romance turned sour is
            told with allusions to medieval French romance and the plight of a
            sleepless lover, unable to view his own reflection because it reminds
            him of his former partner. “D’où sors-tu ; ta douceur tue,” he
            half-speaks, half-sings (“Where are you from; your sweetness kills”).
            The song’s emotional depth and sophisticated, clear production stand
            out on an album that rarely comes up short. Other standouts include
            “Takotsubo” and “Ciel Noir.”

            Angry Blackmen was formed in early 2017. The group is comprised of
            two members: Quentin Branch and Brian Warren, who met on location
            of a music video shoot back in 2014. In December of 2016 Brian came
            up with the idea of the group and Quentin later designed the now
            iconic logo.
            <br>
            <br>
            From 2017-2018 Angry Blackmen released a slew of singles gaining a
            cult-like following and being featured on popular blogs like Lyrical
            Lemonade, Earmilk, Elevator etc. In early 2019, Angry Blackmen
            released their debut EP “Talkshit!” to underground critical acclaim.
            <br>
            <br>
            This track “Riot” is packed full of energy. In their music video for
            the track, Quentin and Brian, bring even more enthusiasm, knocking
            items off shelves in a store, breaking items, and burning the
            American flag, asking their audience “if they’re down to start a riot”.
            The duo’s smart verses, impressive delivery, and energy all make
            “Riot” an exciting listen.

            Greentea Peng’s “Downers” is a beautiful, yet somber R&B track.
            After pressing play, the first thing you hear is this clean string
            sequence, which is then looped to make up part of the production.
            <br>
            <br>
            The clean production and the strings immediately stand out, but after
            a couple of repetitions, The London singer comes in with a smooth
            chorus, showcasing her amazing voice and introducing her audience to
            the song’s subject matter.
            <br>
            <br>
            She sings: “I can’t smell flowers, felt empty now for hours, lost my
            powers, I can’t smell the flowers, I’m sick of all these towers, done
            too many downers”.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can immediately hear the sadness in her voice, detailing mental
            health issues and problems with antidepressants. Greentea Peng can
            no longer smell the roses, and is struggling with day to day life.
            She goes from verse to verse describing her struggles with mental
            health, feeling lonely, estranged from friends, and coping by getting
            high.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the Greentea Peng’s amazing voice, to the incredible production,
            as well as the intense emotions conveyed by the lyrics of the track,
            “Downers” is a track that is definitely worth a listen. The track
            initially came out as a
