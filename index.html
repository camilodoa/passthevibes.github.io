        In the modern day and age, everyday music listeners have access to
        millions of songs at the click of the button or tap of a screen.
        With this access, it’s tedious to search for new music, and easy to fall
        into the habit of only listening to our favorites or the top hits.
        <br>
        <br>
        We created SLEPTON as a blog for people around the world to share
        recently released, under-the-radar tracks and albums. Each post has a
        short but meaningful editorial, justifying why that artist, track or
        album deserves a listen.
        <br>
        <br>
        What makes SLEPTON different?
        <br>
        <br>
        SLEPTON provides a communal experience for music listeners around the
        globe. Anyone can contribute to the blog, all you have to do is pick one
        of your favorite songs that you think deserves more attention and submit

        <span>Kaiit - "Miss Shiney"</span>

        <div class='article'>
          Kaiit’s “Miss Shiney” is your new neo-soul jam. Throughout the song,
          Kaiit builds a metaphor of herself as a diamond.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the hook she sings: “I got pressure, she calls me diamond on the weekdays”
          She paints a picture of herself as Miss Shiney, a diamond who shines
          bright, yet deals with pressure on a regular basis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Later, she brings the listener further into her head and details how
          doubting herself and overthinking are at the root of a lot of her
          life’s stress, singing: “Now that’s wack, I don’t know how to act, a
          false reality that I seem to created in my head, to make me feel I’m
          not deserving of these things I do”.
          <br>
          <br>
          The lyrics are catchy, and emotional. However, the song really caught
          my ear because of the beautiful pairing between Kait’s voice, the
          soulful piano, funky guitar, and simple drum beat. She floats over
          the instrumental, describing the stresses and pressure she puts on
          herself, while implying that she’s still a diamond, shining bright.

            London producer J Rick is back with “Gone”. The song came out Thursday,
            May 24th and continues to showcase his ability and versatility as a
            producer. After producing several tracks for rising UK artist Octavian,
            including his breakout single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz7eyvAMOpA" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Party Here”</a>, J Rick is focusing on
            his own project, No Retreat, No Surrender. “Gone” is the second
            single for the project, after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWvbFN7yhMs" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Short”</a>, which came out back in February.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both tracks are marked by intriguing samples of vocals and tracks
            layered into fluid, changing, synthy beat. “Gone” starts with a sample
            from J Ricks late uncle, British boxer Errol Christie, speaking on
            boxing as one of the only ways for Black people to make it and later
            flips a handful of lyrics from Blackstreet’s 1994 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC6TnBx0HIU" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“Before I Let You Go”</a>, before mixing in vocals from a viral
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmMcM8Eb6p4" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">clip</a> of a sermon
            from Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. The samples work perfectly with a
            beat that is always changing, yet keeping the same central themes
            and elements.
            <br>
            <br>
            The music video is equally as exciting. The video adds to the
            feel of “Gone”, pairing the audio with a montage of clips of J Rick
            adventuring, but also the wide variety of other people, places,
            and sights that were a part of his trip to Egypt. The track and
            the video stand out as another creative expression from a talented
            producer, trying to showcase his own individual artistry as opposed
            to taking a backseat to a vocalist. “Gone” is a funky, experimental
            track that adds to the growing hype around J Rick, and his upcoming
            project.

            Ever since his release back in May, rising DMV rapper Xanman has
            been releasing song after song. He started with
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3WGp3lKoss" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">"Pink"
            </a>
            and his
            collab with YungManny
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73mOe7KHFg8" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">“First Day Out”</a>, and then released the Big
            Plug N*gga mixtape.
            <br>
            <br>
            His most recent track, is “Hell Yea”, the intro to his upcoming
            mixtape, Hell Yeah. For the past year and a half, Xanman has shown
            off his singing as well as his ability to craft great punchlines.
            “Hell Yea” is all bars. Xanman shows off his energy over a menacing
            beat and spits several catchy lines.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the bars that immediately caught my ear were in his first
            verse when he raps: “I grab the choppa, You better lay there, Walk
            in his house with the Drake, Take Care”. He shortens drako
            (mini AK-47) to Drake, and then uses the second half of the line to
            warn anyone he approaches when armed by referencing Drake’s 2011
            album, Take Care.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Hell Yeaa” is a hard-hitting Xanman song full of energy and clever
            punchlines. Xanman released the song as a music video, which
            showcases his personality while he raps and dances around with a
            posse (and some random people in costumes) in New York City.

          <div class='article'>
            After last July’s set of 3 concerts on U St. in D.C., Goldlink
            thanked the fans from his hometown, and let them know that his next
            project would be distinct from all of his previous work. Just under
            a year later, he dropped Diaspora, a proud celebration of Black
            music and culture with a variety of features hailing from all over
            the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            On Tiff Freestyle, one of the “featureless” songs, Goldlink’s verse
            is introduced and followed by the popular British DJ Tiffany Calver.
            Tiff does her best American accent hyping up Goldlink, which is
            actually pretty convincing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Goldlink’s verse, is an honest reflection on his journey done over
            a smooth piano instrumental. He starts by discussing his aspirations
            to make money and provide for his future children. Goldlink then
            reminisces about hot and hectic DC summers, and talks about his
            come-up.
            <br>
            <br>
            He saves his best bars for last, ending the freestyle highlighting
            his current lavish lifestyle through a few major references to
            Michael Jackson, Prince and Michael Vick. He raps: “I live a life
            like Michael and keep it purple like Prince, Keep like 7 with me,
            got n*ggas callin’ me Vick”.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Tiff Freestyle” is a Goldlink track that may not get as much
            attention as some of the other tracks on Diaspora that pack major
            features, but it is another very strong track from the DC rapper.
