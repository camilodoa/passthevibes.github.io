        millions of songs at the click of the button or tap of a screen.

            London producer J Rick is back with “Gone”. The song came out Thursday,
            May 24th and continues to showcase his ability and versatility as a
            producer. After producing several tracks for rising UK artist Octavian,
            including his breakout single “Party Here”, J Rick is focusing on
            his own project, No Retreat, No Surrender. “Gone” is the second
            single for the project, after “Short”, which came out back in February.

            Both tracks are marked by intriguing samples of vocals and tracks
            layered into fluid, changing, synthy beat. “Gone” starts with a sample
            from J Ricks late uncle, British boxer Errol Christie, speaking on
            boxing as one of the only ways for Black people to make it and later
            flips a handful of lyrics from Blackstreet’s 1994 “Before I Let
            You Go”, before mixing in vocals from a viral clip of a sermon
            from Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. The samples work perfectly with a
            beat that is always changing, yet keeping the same central themes
            and elements.

            The music video is equally as exciting. The video adds to the
            feel of “Gone”, pairing the audio with a montage of clips of J Rick
            adventuring, but also the wide variety of other people, places,
            and sights that were a part of his trip to Egypt. The track and
            the video stand out as another creative expression from a talented
            producer, trying to showcase his own individual artistry as opposed
            to taking a backseat to a vocalist. “Gone” is a funky, experimental
            track that adds to the growing hype around J Rick, and his upcoming
            project.
