          The July 4th episode of Kendall Jenner and Daniel Chetrit’s ZAZA WORLD
          RADIO on Apple Music featured a premier of an unreleased track from
          rising UK artist Bakar. The singer/rapper hailing from Camden, London
          released his debut album Badkid back in May 2018, attracting
          attention in the UK and around the world.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you haven’t heard of Bakar, <i>Badkid</i> is an amazing album,
          highlighting his versatility and influences from classic rock to
          alternative/indie music to hip-hop. However, Bakar’s newest song,
          “Hell & Back”, has a completely different feel from his debut album.
          Bakar stated that he hopes people listen to this track “in the sun”,
          and the song sounds decidedly warmer and more upbeat than the majority
          of the songs on <i>Badkid</i>. The track starts with whistling, over a light
          guitar based instrumental. However, the instrumental is amazingly
          paired with horns from the Onyx Collective’s Isaiah Barr. Throughout
          the track, Bakar showcases his unique voice, singing about meeting a
          lover. One of the lines that immediately stands out is early in the
          song he sings that “she had green eyes like Mountain Dew”, which
          creatively paints a picture in the listener’s head.
          <br>
          <br>
          Bakar cited Camden legend Amy Winehouse as a major influence on
          “Hell & Back” and his upcoming project <i>Will You Be My Yellow?</i>,
          which is slated to release on August 23. An official version has not yet
          been released at the moment, but linked is a rip from ZAZA World
          Radio’s “THE BEST DAYS OF OUR LIVES” episode. Give this track a listen
          and keep an eye out for Bakar’s <i>Will You Be My Yellow?</i>.

        <span>Nekfeu – "Les Étoiles Vagabondes" </span>
      </header>
        <section>
          <div class="video">

          <div class='article'>
            Nekfeu began his career as one of the standout members of 1995, a hip
            hop collective named for the era of French and American music that
            they took as inspiration. Since the group’s 2011 LP <i>Paris Sud
            Minute</i>, Nekfeu has risen to superstardom in his native France,
            appearing in films and releasing dance-ready hits that endeared him
            to the broader public, with the help of a slow transition of his
            appearance from crate digger to hot celebrity.
            <br>
            <br>
            His new album, <i>Les Étoiles Vagabondes</i> – Vagabond Stars – sees Nekfeu
            leave club music behind and return to the more traditional flows
            that earned him a loyal audience with 1995. Over interesting
            production and alongside gifted featured artists like Damso,
            Nekfeu tells stories rooted in personal experience but vague enough
            to be relatable to a broader audience. Individual tracks can be
            hit-or-miss, but as a whole the album is a new sound for the rapper
            that seems to synthesize his pop and hip-hop influences.

            Perhaps the best track on the album is “Elle Pleut” (“She
            Rains/Cries”). On it, Nek showcases his ability to weave a compelling
            story while navigating a melancholy beat that pairs ambient harmonies
            with a sparse drum sample that drops out for the verse, leaving him
            to rap almost unaccompanied. The story of a romance turned sour is
            told with allusions to medieval French romance and the plight of a
            sleepless lover, unable to view his own reflection because it reminds
            him of his former partner. “D’où sors-tu ; ta douceur tue,” he
            half-speaks, half-sings (“Where are you from; your sweetness kills”).
            The song’s emotional depth and sophisticated, clear production stand
            out on an album that rarely comes up short. Other standouts include
            “Takotsubo” and “Ciel Noir.”

          <div class='article'>
            Angry Blackmen was formed in early 2017. The group is comprised of
            two members: Quentin Branch and Brian Warren, who met on location
            of a music video shoot back in 2014. In December of 2016 Brian came
            up with the idea of the group and Quentin later designed the now
            iconic logo.
            <br>
            <br>
            From 2017-2018 Angry Blackmen released a slew of singles gaining a
            cult-like following and being featured on popular blogs like Lyrical
            Lemonade, Earmilk, Elevator etc. In early 2019, Angry Blackmen
            released their debut EP “Talkshit!” to underground critical acclaim.
            <br>
            <br>
            This track “Riot” is packed full of energy. In their music video for
            the track, Quentin and Brian, bring even more enthusiasm, knocking
            items off shelves in a store, breaking items, and burning the
            American flag, asking their audience “if they’re down to start a riot”.
            The duo’s smart verses, impressive delivery, and energy all make
            “Riot” an exciting listen.

            Greentea Peng’s “Downers” is a beautiful, yet somber R&B track.
            After pressing play, the first thing you hear is this clean string
            sequence, which is then looped to make up part of the production.
            <br>
            <br>
            The clean production and the strings immediately stand out, but after
            a couple of repetitions, The London singer comes in with a smooth
            chorus, showcasing her amazing voice and introducing her audience to
            the song’s subject matter.
            <br>
            <br>
            She sings: “I can’t smell flowers, felt empty now for hours, lost my
            powers, I can’t smell the flowers, I’m sick of all these towers, done
            too many downers”.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can immediately hear the sadness in her voice, detailing mental
            health issues and problems with antidepressants. Greentea Peng can
            no longer smell the roses, and is struggling with day to day life.
            She goes from verse to verse describing her struggles with mental
            health, feeling lonely, estranged from friends, and coping by getting
            high.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the Greentea Peng’s amazing voice, to the incredible production,
            as well as the intense emotions conveyed by the lyrics of the track,
            “Downers” is a track that is definitely worth a listen. The track
            initially came out as a
